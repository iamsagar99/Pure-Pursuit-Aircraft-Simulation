# Pure-Pursuit-Aircraft-Simulation
The project is a fighter aircraft simulation where a fighter plane shoots bullets at a moving bomber. The bomber follows a curved path based on the equation A Sin(kX), and the fighter calculates the sine angle to accurately shoot the bomber.

### Features

- Fighter plane and bomber are displayed on a graphical interface.
- The bomber moves in a curved path, adding an element of challenge to the simulation.
- The fighter plane shoots bullets at the bomber.
- The simulation includes city structures that can be destroyed by bombs dropped by the bomber.

### Installation

To run the Fighter Aircraft Simulation, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the source code files.
3. Compile the Java files using the following command:
   ```
   javac ModelPanel.java
   ```
4. Run the application with the following command:
   ```
   java ModelPanel
   ```

### How to Simulate

- Just run the ModelPanel.java file.
- The fighter plane will automatically shoot bullets at the bomber.
- Avoid colliding with bombs dropped by the bomber.
- Defend the city structures by shooting down the bomber.
